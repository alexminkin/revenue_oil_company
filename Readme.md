Choosing location for an oil well
Oil samples were provided in three regions: in each 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. It is necessary to build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where mining will bring the greatest profit. 

Steps to choose a location:
- In the selected region, they are looking for deposits, for each, the values of the signs are determined;
- Build a model and estimate the volume of reserves;
- Select the deposits with the highest value estimates. The number of fields depends on the company's budget and the cost of developing one well;
- The profit is equal to the total profit of the selected fields.
